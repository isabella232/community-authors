# Prisma Tutorials Code Formatting

In order to maintain code formatting consistency between articles in the Prisma Community Tutorials, we recommend using **Prettier** to standardize any example code. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter and automatically formats any code run through it.

All code in Prisma Community Tutorials should be run by Prettier, whether in a code editor, or within the [Prettier Playground](https://bitly.com/2Sp0d3a). Prettier works with many editors, including VS Code, Atom, and Sublime Text, and the full list can be found on the Prettier site.

In addition to the standard prettier configuration, Prisma Community Tutorials should also use the the following Prettier options:

```
"prettier.singleQuote": true,
"prettier.trailingComma": "all",
"prettier.semi": false,
```

# Tutorial Type

There are three kinds of tutorials that we hope to publish in the Community:

### Procedural

Procedurals are tutorials that walk an individual through accomplishing a certain specific task. For example, “How to deploy a Prisma server to EC2.”

These tutorials should be language specific, self-contained, and always leave the reader with some sort of finished product (for example an app that does what was described).

All concepts mentioned throughout the tutorial should be explained thoroughly, as if the reader has very little background knowledge of the subject. However, explanations should be brief. If you find that you repeatedly need to spend a long time explaining concepts throughout the tutorial, it may indicate a need for a conceptual tutorial that offers some background on the subject.

### Conceptual

Conceptual tutorials are an opportunity to help people get more familiar with a concept. They are focused on explanations and context building.

After reading through a conceptual tutorial, a reader should not necessarily have any concrete code, nor even commands to accomplish a task. Instead, they should be familiar with the concept being described. After this, for example, they should be able to complete a procedural tutorial with a full understanding of all the steps without needing them to be deeply explained in that tutorial.

For this reason conceptual tutorials and procedural ones can often be paired together and complement each other.

### Exemplar

Exemplars are shorter tutorials that show multiple examples of achieving a specific goal or addressing a certain problem. Examples listed in these articles do not need to build on each other, but each one should be explained briefly but thoroughly.

An example of an exemplar topic could be: “ 4 ways to handle errors in a graphql API”

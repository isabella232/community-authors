## Introduction

We’re so excited to be working with you to build out Prisma Community tutorials. Our goal is to help developers in all the stages of their development and decision making process.

In order to keep articles consistent across the site, we have developed a number of style, content, and formatting guidelines. A reader should be able to switch seamlessly between various Prisma tutorials and find the same characteristics, regardless of the author or topic.

# Tutorial Style

Prisma Articles seek to educate the reader above all.

### Detailed

While we want people to be able to use the tutorials in order to simply complete a certain task, a reader should also come away from a tutorial with new knowledge. Tutorials should explain the why behind each step and recommendation that they make. Users should understand what the steps they are taking do, what the packages they are installing contain, etc.

### Written one level below your assumptions of a person’s knowledge

With many of the complex topics being covered, tutorials should always go out of their way to explain concepts. As you write a tutorial, you can assume that the reader has some basic knowledge— but the tutorial should be written as if the reader had just learned them, and still seeks clarity. This is because it is easier for someone deeply familiar with a topic to skip over certain explanations than for someone just learning it to fill in the details. The additional explanations can fill in the different blank spots that individuals may have in their knowledge.

### Technically Correct and Tested

Tutorials should work from start to finish just by following the instructions. Always test your articles from scratch. Note where you run into issues, whether from dependencies, things being out of date, etc. If you have an issue, the reader may experience it as well: consider adding a troubleshooting section to help the reader through it. Ensure that tutorials do not need additional commands or steps.

### Friendly and Objective

The tone of the tutorials should be straightforward, approachable, and friendly. At the same time, we want to ensure that the tutorials remain focused on the core elements of the piece. Distractions such as excessive humor, memes, etc, should be minimized. Additionally, we want the tutorial to be as objective as possible— keeping a neutral tone in the article will ensure that people feel the information can be trusted.

# Tutorial Type

There are three kinds of tutorials that we hope to publish in the Community:

### Procedural

Procedurals are tutorials that walk an individual through accomplishing a certain specific task. For example, “How to deploy a Prisma server to EC2.”

These tutorials should be language specific, self-contained, and always leave the reader with some sort of finished product (for example an app that does what was described).

All concepts mentioned throughout the tutorial should be explained thoroughly, as if the reader has very little background knowledge of the subject. However, explanations should be brief. If you find that you repeatedly need to spend a long time explaining concepts throughout the tutorial, itt may indicate a need for a conceptual tutorial that offers some background on the subject.

### Conceptual

Conceptual tutorials are an opportunity to help people get more familiar with a concept. They are focused on explanations and context building.

After reading through a conceptual tutorial, a reader should not necessarily have any concrete code, nor even commands to accomplish a task. Instead, they should be familiar with the concept being described. After this, for example, they should be able to complete a procedural tutorial with a full understanding of all the steps without needing them to be deeply explained in that tutorial.

For this reason conceptual tutorials and procedural ones can often be paired together and complement each other.

### Exemplar

Exemplars are shorter tutorials that show multiple examples of achieving a specific goal or addressing a certain problem. Examples listed in these articles do not need to build on each other, but each one should be explained briefly but thoroughly.

An example of an exemplar topic could be: “ 4 ways to handle errors in a graphql API”
